# OOP-Calculator-Project

This project was meant to create an application that implements the functionality of a scientific computer.
- can evaluate mathematical expressions that contain round and / or square brackets
- supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, radical
- the equations will be entered from the keyboard. The user will write the equation on a line, and when the Enter key is pressed, the application will display the result. The computer will accept new equations until the user enters "exit"
- for invalid expressions the computer will display an error message
- the application can process the equations in a text file (one equation per line) and will display the results in the console or in another text file (the user can choose between the two options)
